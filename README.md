# Rotator Selector
A WordPress plugin that places a checkbox under each attachment item labeled as "Rotator".  Rotator can then be queried in an argument using WP_Query within the WordPress loop.  These images can then be featured in a custom image rotator that has to be programmed into a WordPress template inside the theme.
